System Requirements
-------------------

riot supports Python 3.6+ and can be run with CPython or PyPy.


Installation
------------

doxxie can be installed from PyPI with::

.. note::
   riot does not yet have a stable API so it is recommended to pin the riot
   version to avoid having to deal with breaking changes.
